### Your research topic and hypothesis
Problem Statement: Does Subscribers take more rides on weekdays than Customers?

Null Hypothesis: Customers take the same or more number of rides than Subscribers during Weekdays.

### Feedback on the research plan
1. The Null and alternative hypotheses are established correctly.

2. All the data needed in this research can be processed from the CitiBike raw data.
Based on the Null hypotheses, I think the 'Weekdays' excluded the data of 'weekends',
so I would suggest drop the data of Saturday and Sunday.

### Suggested test
As the two samples (Subscribers and Customers) here are the daily counts of trips during weekdays in January(31 days) 2017, meaning the size of the sample is 22 (<30).
So the task is to compare the mean values of the daily counts of trips in 22 days.
In this case, I would suggest using the one-tailed t-test.

Good luck!

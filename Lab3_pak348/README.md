### Formulate the Null hypothesis in words and in formulae for the 4 experiments below:

**Do diets help lose more fat than the exercise?**

Experimental setup:

You have a test and a control sample. 

Modified Hypothesis:

The Percentage of people who excercised alone for a year lost more weight on an average, compared to the people who were on a diet alone. The persons who dieted and excercised and people who did not do either were not considered for devising the model. 

Null Hypothesis: 

The people who were only on a diet lost more or the were at the same weight on an average as compare to teh people only excercising.


**Quantify the danger of smoking for pregnant women.** (Olds et al., 1994, p. 223)

Experimemtal setup: measure IQ of children at ages 1, 2, 3, and 4 years of age.

Modified Hypothesis: For the higher percentage of Smoking Pregnant Women the average IQ of Children reduces.

Null Hypothesis: There is an increase or no change in the IQ of children compared to the percentage of smoking women.


**Contribute to the incidence of diabetes** 
Food deserts are defined as parts of the country vapid of fresh fruit, vegetables, and other healthful whole foods, usually found in impoverished areas. This is largely due to a lack of grocery stores, farmers' markets, and healthy food providers.

This is not a lab experiment, but you have data the incidence of diabetes for the US population.

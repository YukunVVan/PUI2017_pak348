# PUI2017 HW 5.

This Repository contains the work done for Homework Assignment - 5

I worked on my own for most of the Assignement. 


## Assignment 1: Test the Z test: 

(all simulated data)


Generated N samples from a Laplace distribution with a chosen mean μ = 100 and standard deviation σ: N(μ, σ) and calculated the mean of each sample (all samples having the same size n). 

Assessed the validity of the Z-test: From samples drawn from the distribution that is subject to test, the z-values calculated follow a N(0,1) distribution (a Gaussian with mean 0 and standard deviation 1). The distribution of z -statistics that was calculated using  is indeed consistent with N(0,1).

### Things Done: 

Plot original distribution

plot at least one of the samples

plot the distribution of z statistics

fit the z-statistics with a gaussian model and assess the goodness of fit with a simple test (AD or KS).



## Assignment 2: Compare Tests for Goodness of fit
Followed the skeleton notebook [Assignment 2](https://github.com/fedhere/PUI2017_fb55/blob/master/HW5_fb55/Assignment2_instructions.ipynb)

Tested and showed that binomial and Poisson distribution look increasingly more similar to Gaussians as the mean of the distribution increases.


## Assignment 3: investigate linear relationships between fire arm possession, homicides by fire arms, and mass shootings for different countries, considering also the country GDP


Followed instructions in [this skeleton notebook] (https://github.com/fedhere/PUI2017_fb55/blob/master/HW5_fb55/Assignment3_instructionsUpdated.ipynb and derived Conclusions drawn from the analysis.

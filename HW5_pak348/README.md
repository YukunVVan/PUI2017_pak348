# PUI2017 HW 5.

This Repository contains the work done for Homework Assignment - 5

I worked on my own for most of the Assignement. 


## Assignment 1: Test the Z test: 

(all simulated data)


Generate N samples from a distribution of your choice, **but not a Gaussian** with a chosen mean μ and standard deviation σ:   N(μ, σ) and calculate the mean of each sample (all samples should have the same size n). 

Assess the validity of the Z-test: If the samples are drawn from the distribution you are testing the z-values you calculate should follow a N(0,1) distribution (a Gaussian with mean 0 and standard deviation 1). Show that the distribution of z -statistics (find the formula in a statistics book or in last week’s slides) that you calculated (one for each sample) is indeed consistent with N(0,1).


### Grading: 
you must:

plot your original distribution

plot at least one of the samples

plot the distribution of z statistics

fit the z-statistics with a gaussian model and assess the goodness of fit with a simple test (AD or KS).

find the best fit values for the model parameters (mean and standard deviation) by minimizing the model chi square.

plots need have caption, axis labels, etx and comment your figures and test results appropriately (to demonstrate your understanding).




## Assignment 2: Compare Tests for Goodness of fit
Follow the skeleton notebook [Assignment 2](https://github.com/fedhere/PUI2017_fb55/blob/master/HW5_fb55/Assignment2_instructions.ipynb)
Test that in fact binomial and Poisson distribution look increasingly more similar to Gaussians as the mean of the distribution increases.


### GRADING: 

Your notebook should show the distributions, the models, clearly state the H0 null hypothesis, and properly interpret the tests (remember captions, significance, etc etc)

## Assignment 3: investigate linear relationships between fire arm possession, homicides by fire arms, and mass shootings for different countries, considering also the country GDP


Follow instructions in [this skeleton notebook](https://github.com/fedhere/PUI2017_fb55/blob/master/HW5_fb55/Assignment3_instructionsUpdated.ipynb)

### Grading 
Usual grading scheme applies. Remember that succesfully fitting a line to data is not sufficient. Comment on what conclusions can be drawn from your analysis (and don't jump to conclusions!)
